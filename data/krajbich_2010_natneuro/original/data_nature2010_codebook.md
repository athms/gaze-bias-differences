Each row of the data represents one fixation.  The duration of the fixation is given by the column labeled "event_duration" and is in units of milliseconds.  The variable "Choice" indicates the choice that the subject made in that trial, 1 is left and 0 is right. The variable "roi" indicates whether the fixation was to the left ("1) or the right ("2").  The variable "rt" is the reaction time for the trial. "fix_num" is the number of the fixation within the trial, with 1 being first fixation, 2 being second fixation etc.  Similarly, "rev_fix_num" is the number of the fixation but going backwards from the last fixation, so 1 is the last fixation, 2 is the second-to-last fixation, etc.   Please ignore the variables "corr_fix_duration", "computed_rt" and "temp", I either did not end up using those or they were temporary variables.
